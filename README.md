## Installation

### Software required

These are the programs that need to be installed and available to be
executed in the command line from any directory.

#### sips - scriptable image processing system
This comes pre-installed in OSX. It's a tool for -among other things-
resizing images. It should be in the path. Try it out by executing the
following:

```bash
sips
```

That should print out the program information.

#### XLD - X Lossless Decoder: Lossless Audio Decoder for OSX
You can get it [here](http://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html).

Once you have it installed, you have to make sure that the xld
command line tool is installed. The command line version is 
included in the dmg package; so take it out and put it inside your
/usr/bin directory.

#### MP4v2 Command Line Tools
This can be installed quite easily with Homebrew.

```bash
brew install mp4v2
```
